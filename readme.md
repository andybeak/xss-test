# Naive testing of XSS filtering

This project was used to experiment with the XSS filtering in [voku/anti-xss](https://github.com/voku/anti-xss).
It's just a base to use to quickly generate test cases.  A lot of the test strings wouldn't be triggered in the main file and you'll need to edit and tweak things to experiment.
